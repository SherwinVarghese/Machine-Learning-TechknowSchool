    "You need to know some basic calculus in order to understand how functions change over time (derivatives), and to calculate the total amount of a quantity that accumulates over a time period (integrals). The language of calculus will allow you to speak precisely about the properties of functions and better understand their behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally taking a calculus course involves doing lots of tedious calculations by hand, but having the power of computers on your side can make the process much more fun. This section describes the key ideas of calculus which you'll need to know to understand machine learning concepts.\n"

Computing the derivative of a function is essentially the same as our original proposal, but instead of finding the two closest points, we make up an imaginary point an infinitesimally small distance away from and compute the slope between and the new point.\n",

A very, very, very small distance, but large enough to calculate the slope.\n",
    "\n",

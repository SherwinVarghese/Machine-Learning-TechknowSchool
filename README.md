### Our First Offering: Basic Cloud Application Development

<!--
Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of
the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud-native is about howapplications are created and deployed, 
not where. It implies that the apps live in the public cloud, as opposed to an on-premises datacenter.
-->

Cloud Native development allows IT and software to move faster, keep up with the competition, and ultimately deliver better services to customers. With this motive, we bring to you the first offering on “Basic Cloud Application Development”.
<br>
This course is targeted for developers who have a basic understanding of JAVA and would help them to build a complete application involving end to end concepts. The Basic Cloud Application Development curriculum will include the essential steps to learn, develop and deploy a JAVA based business application on SCP Cloud Foundry. Starting with the key elements, setting up your working environment, to using Cloud Foundry for deployment, creating data models and understanding HANA CDS, OData services, working with Fiori templates and finally putting them all together with CAP (Cloud Application Programming) model of development - you will learn all of this.
<br>
Leveraging available learning references with additional hands on/boot-camp experiences, including guidance from experts to work in groups on assignments spread over a period of couple of months, will enable you to learn and develop the skills not only for your current day-to-day work but also for your future and help you to stay relevant in the context of Intelligent Enterprise.
